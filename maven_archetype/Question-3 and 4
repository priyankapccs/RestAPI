3-What key features do you think the application lacks?
Below is the Key Feature which application lack:
1- User is not able to create a New Product but in requirement it is given that new product can be added but cannot be deleted.So there was no API for that
2-Requirement was when Create API is send with Price that is different from Product API, 404 error should come but this is not happening.It is just 
over-riding the request price with Product Price.
3-â€‚IN View API requirement it is given that : Retrieve a package in the specified currency using the latest foreign exchange rate; default to USD if no currency is provided
  But when currency is specified i.e in EUR, the response is still showing in USD
  
  
4. What would you put in place to ensure this application can be used in an always-on,high-traffic environment?  How would you test for this?
   By doing Load and Stress testing of the application.We can set a performance benchmark of application and if the traffic increase we can consider on 
   upgrading the web hosting. And also we should recovery test that mean how well an application is able to recover from crashes, hardware failures and 
   other similar problems. Recovery testing is the forced failure of the software in a variety of ways to verify that recovery is properly performed.
